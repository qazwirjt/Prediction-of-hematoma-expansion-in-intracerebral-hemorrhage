# Prediction-of-hematoma-expansion-in-intracerebral-hemorrhage


This is a web app for predicting spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) hematoma expansion. Users can upload original medical imaging files and their corresponding segmentation masks, and input clinical data for a convenient prediction. Due to the sensitivity and specific characteristics of medical image files, you may download the code for local execution.
